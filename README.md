🌱 **About Me** <br />
I'm a PhD student exploring the field of human-robot interaction. My background includes time in automotive engineering and a stint in tech startups, but now I'm back in academia. I've always been drawn to how technology can solve practical problems and make a difference. While I've gathered a range of experiences, I see myself as a lifelong learner, constantly curious and open to new challenges.

🧩 **My Approach** <br />
For me, it's all about addressing challenges with a sense of humility and a focus on blending technical expertise with user-centric design. Efficiency is key, but the real reward lies in how these solutions positively impact everyday life. This grounded approach guides me through various disciplines, always with the priority of understanding and enhancing the way technology interfaces with people. <br />

🛠 **Skills and Expertise** <br />
**Cross-Disciplinary Knowledge**: Mechanical engineering, electronics and software development <br />
**Team Collaboration**: Although I have diverse knowledge and experiences, I have found that my favourite projects are those that involve collaborating with diverse teams. <br />
**Adaptable Learner**: Continuously exploring new technologies and approaches, applying them pragmatically to solve the appropriate problems <br />

⚙️ **Current Work and Skills** <br />
**Current Projects**: Focusing on developing user studies to gather user requirements and collaborating with doctors to build innovative healthcare technology as part of the Learn2Innovate program <br />
**Programming Languages**: Currently using Python to develop interactive robot behaviour <br />
**Learn2Innovate**: I have joined the Learn2Innovate program, and I am currently working with medical students to develop a health-tech/med-tech solution (due to end on 27 April 2024) <br />
**Web Development**: I am learning Next.js to learn how to build scalable and maintainable websites. <br />

💼 **Professional Highlights** <br />
**PhD Research at Bristol University**: Advancing the field of human-robot interaction. <br />
**Co-founder at 3D Farms**: Pioneering in automated nutrient control systems. <br />
**ADAS System Architect at Jaguar Land Rover**: Focusing on enhancing driver safety through technology. <br />

📚 **Education** <br />
**PhD in Human-Robot Interaction** - Bristol University (Ongoing) <br />
**MEng in Mechanical Engineering** - Cardiff University <br />

🏆 **Key Projects and Achievements** <br />
**Robotic + Care Hackathon 2023 Winner**: Developed a social care robot to aid in healthcare settings. <br />
